Instructions:

1. Run clips
2. Execute the command: (load "chainshot")

Note this will start the game and you'll be able to follow along.
I've included the sample input provided in the Sakai discussions by the professor, the file is called "sample.txt".

AI:

In order to run the AI select either option 2 or 3 from the prompt once the program asks for a player type. If option 1 is selected the same logic from the first submission will execute.

Possible solvable steps are ((4 . 5) (3 . 4) (4 . 2) (3 . 2) (1 . 1) (1 . 3) (1 . 1))
